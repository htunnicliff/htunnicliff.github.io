## Welcome

I'm very __glad__ to introduce my new website!  
It's a static website that I have done in less than 3 hours with this [Hugo tutorial](https://fillmem.com/post/self-hosted-fast-secured-and-free-static-site/)

Here is some test code for the syntax highlighter:
<pre>
  <code class="language-css">
  body {
    font-family: "Noto Sans", sans-serif;
  }
  </code>
</pre>

More code (in Python):
<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
  >>> from pygments.styles import get_all_styles
  >>> styles = list(get_all_styles())
  >>> print styles
  </code>
</pre>
